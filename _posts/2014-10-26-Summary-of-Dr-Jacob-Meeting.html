#Summary of the meeting with Dr. Jacob on 10/23

###Crystallinity and Orientation
-Dr. Jacob recommended the approach suggested by Dr. Kalidindi
    -Find vector across 4 adjacent atoms, and compare that to the average vector of all the chains within a voxel
    -Suggested performing a 3D orientation (3D Herman's) to get a more complete idea of the orientation (Herman's may calculate unaligned lamella as aligned)
-Crystallinity is typically defined as 8 monomers (best resolution from x-ray)
-The crystals could break up but more likely they are simply shifting and translating
-In these simulations we expect the crystallinity to increase with time
-Orientation increases with tension (polymer in tension will become more crystalline)
-In the simulation, stretching is just a crystalline extension, there is no shearing for the simulation (therefore crystallinity will not drop)

###Files
-The aniso files are likely okay to use until the point of "necking"
-He will try to see if Xin will give up all timesteps for pe400tilt6l

###Dr. Jacob thinks that an investigation of 3-pt corellations would be interesting and is something that has not been done before.
