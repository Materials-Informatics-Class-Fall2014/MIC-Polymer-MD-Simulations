### Plots

The purpose of this post is to highlight a few plots that may be able to shed light on some of the phenomena seen in the aniso simulations. All plots are from the dump.deform375_10e7_5aniso_14 simulation file. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV_VQytVpWA&list=UUEwX0kbfZjeSX6rI5OGOgHg) video shows the entire aniso_14 simulation

### Relevant Codes

The codes which produced these plots can be found at this [link](https://github.com/alohse/MIC-Polymer-MD-Simulations/tree/gh-pages/CODES)

**The relevant codes include:**

* read_conv_data_nhp_v2.m : This script reads the plaintext simulation files and produces a Matlab file (total_info_xx.mat), containing arrays of the time-steps, number of monomers, bounds of the simulation volume and locations of all monomers and chains for the length of the simulation. _Note that the original aniso files have some corrupted data which must be removed for the script to function._

* plot_vol_displacement_timestep.m : This script generates three plots for each simulation dataset
