## Introduction


## Results

_The following image shows slices of the autocorrelation for a semicrystalline voxel of the tilt6l simulation at 0.1 strain_

![tilt_auto]({{page.results[0]}})

_In the following 3D image a threshold is applied to the autocorrelation so that only 5.0% of the vectors are above the threshold_

![tilt_auto_thresh]({{page.results[1]}})

_In the following image the three crystallinity measures and their thresholds are compared for a slice of the tilt6l simulation at 0.1 strain_

![tilt_measures_dench]({{page.results[2]}})

_The following image shows the autocorrelations on the crystalline phase for the thresholds on all three crystallinity measures for a slice of the tilt6l simulation at 0.1 strain_

![tilt_measures_auto_dench]({{page.results[3]}})

_In the following image each point is associated with the values of the three crystallinity measures at each voxel of the microstructures studied_

![meas_scatter_1]({{page.results[4]}})

_This image is the same as the previous, yet only shows Herman's orientation versus crystalline degree_
