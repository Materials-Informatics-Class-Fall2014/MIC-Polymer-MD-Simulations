## Introduction

In this post the autocorrelations on the thresholds of three measures of crystallinity (density, Herman's orientation and crystalline degree) are compared. In addition, a plot is presented which compares the the three crystallinity measures for individual voxels of a variety of microstructures.

## Review of the crystalline degree measure 

First the microstructure function is generated for the voxel of interest and the 2-pt autocorrelation on the polyethylene monomer is performed. These are slices from the autocorrelation of a semicrystalline voxel of the tilt6l simulation at 0.1 strain.

Next, a threshold is applied to the autocorrelation so that only 5.0% of the vectors are above the threshold.

Finally, the crystalline degree measure is taken as the mean probability of those vectors which exceed the threshold.

## Results

First we examine the values of the crystallinity measures, their thresholds and the associated autocorrelations are shown for a slice of the tilt6l simulation at 0.1 strain. The threshold level is chosen so that the crystalline volume fraction for both density and crystalline degree match that of Herman's orienatation with a 0.6 threshold (cells with a Herman's orientation exceeding 0.6 are considered crystalline). The crystalline volume fraction for this microstructure instantiation is 0.64.
_(voxel density, Herman's orientation and crystalline degree are shown as $\rho$, $\theta$ and  $C^{\circ}$ respectively)_

In the following images each point is associated with the values of the three crystallinity measures at each voxel of the microstructures studied. The purpose of this exercise is to explore the relationships between these measures for as wide a range as possible of polyethylene structures.

_In the following images tilt1 - tilt10 are strain levels 0.1 to 1.0 for the tilt6l simulation, cry2 through cry4 are perfect crystals and amp1 is an equilibriated amorphous microstructure._

Theoretical amorphous structures are being generated using the Polymer Modeler tool on Nanohub.org. This tool allows creation of amorphous polymer structures of user defined density, conformation probabilities, and processing conditions.

Crystalline regions were developed in Matlab with varying sizes. Using [PACKMOL](http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~martinez/packmol/), amorphous and crystalline chains/regions were packed into a box of our simulation size with varying density. In this way we can verify our measures by knowing the exact location of colume fraction of crystalline regions we should receive. The next step is to perform energy minimzation in [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) to get an equilibrated structure and then generate realistic structures through simulation.

## Conclusions ##

* Density appears to have a weak relationship with both Herman's orientation and crystalline degree
* Herman's orientation and crystalline degree are more correlated.
  * A clear division can be drawn between amorphous and purely crystalline regions for both the Herman's orientation and crystalline degree measures.
* For perfect crystals, Herman's orientation in a voxel is always 1.00 while density and crystalline degree may widely vary
  * The 1.00 Herman's orientation is expected as chains are completely aligned in a perfect crystal
  * The density would be expected to converge as the voxel size is increased, though this would also reduce the resolution of the measures
