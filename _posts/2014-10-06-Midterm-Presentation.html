### Introduction

The crystallization behavior of polymers (PE) from the melt is affected by various processing conditions. Through the selection of processing paths and procedures, (e.g. blow molding) the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation in polymeric materials can be controlled. These changes in structure directly affect mechanical properties of interest, therefore it is advantageous to understand how processing leads to structure in this materials system.

We want to characterize the linkage between processing (including material starting condition and the evolution of temperature and the stress/strain state) and structure (including the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation) in semi-crystalline polyethylene.

### Pair Correlations

The pair correlation relates the position of objects in space by the distance between them. The distance between every particle and every other particle is binned into a histogram by radius. In our case we relate the position of each monomer in a chain with the monomers from another chain. Each histogram freqency bin is normalized by the volume of the shell which is bounded by the radii bounding the bin. As our simulation volume is periodic, the second chain is tiled in all directions so that the pair correlation reflects the physical scenario.

### Orientation Calculations



### Current Research Questions

* How can we leverage the pair correlation of two chains to beter understand the crystallinity in our data?

* How finely can we discretize our data without sacrificing accuracy in the determination of crystallinity?

vs.

* How finely must we disretize our data to achive useful spatial statistics?
