### Project Background

The crystallization behavior of polymers (PE) from the melt is affected by various processing conditions. Through the selection of processing paths and procedures, (e.g. [blow molding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blow_molding)) the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation in polymeric materials can be controlled. These changes in structure directly affect mechanical properties of interest, therefore it is advantageous to understand how processing leads to structure in this materials system.

### Project Goals

**Characterize the linkage between processing (including material starting condition and the evolution of temperature and the stress/strain state) and structure (including the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation) in semi-crystalline polyethylene.**


### Datasets

* Primary data generated by molecular dynamics simulations via [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/)
* Possible use of experimental data to verify processing-structure linkages

### Proposed Workflow

1. Specify microstructure function for crystallinity (connected to density and Herman's orientation) and crystalline orientation
2. Discretize the molecular dynamics datasets and post-process to extract relevant microstructural information
3. Perform two-point statistics (auto and cross-correlations) on microstructure datasets at regular intervals on a variety of processing paths
4. Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the microstructure datasets and visualize in PCA space
5. Generate processing - structure linkages through regressions of microstructure evolution paths in PCA space versus selected processing parameters (time, temperature, strain state, etc.)
6. Validate linkage through the prediction of structure given set of processing parameters.

### Visualizations of Datasets

Used codes from Tony as a guide to create codes to visualize the data over the various timesteps.

*Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/alohse/MIC-Polymer-MD-Simulations/tree/gh-pages/CODES)

### 2-pt Statistics

* Basic 2-pt statistics code has been written and is [here](https://github.com/alohse/MIC-Polymer-MD-Simulations/tree/gh-pages/CODES)

### Immediate Work

* Need to decide on appropriate bin size to capture representation of both density and crystal orientation. 
* Intend to describe crystal orientation using Euler angles. 
  ** Need to better understand how we can track these structures through time, does voxel size change/number of voxels?
* Develop code to accurately describe polymer chain vector within a voxel.
