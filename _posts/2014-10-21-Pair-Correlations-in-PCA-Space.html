title: Detecting Chain Similarity through Pair Correlations in PCA Space
tagline: >
  Structurally similar chains were identified by measuring the distances between chains in the PCA space. The PCA representations of structure were derived from pair autocorrelations.

### Procedure Detect Similarity

1. Pair correlations were performed for each chain in the first time-step of a constant-volume uniaxial-tension PEMD simulation.

2. These pair correlation results were represented as points in the PCA space.

_The following plot shows the 20 chains for the first timestep in the pca1 and pca2 components_
