_this image shows the original monomer and chain locations (where each chain has a unique color) with the locations of the voxels at the 8 corners of the simulation volume are outlined in blue_

![voxelized]({{page.pics[0]}})

_In the image below the original monomer locations are shown in yellow while the volumized monomers are represented by the purple markers_

![monomers_invox]({{page.pics[1]}})

_below is a slice of the 2-pt autocorrelation for the monomers in the previous image_

![slice_stats]({{page.pics[2]}})

_below is an image showing all locations in the 3-D voxel where the 2-pt statistics autocorrelation probability exceeds 15%_

![stats_prob_thresh_015]({{page.pics[3]}})

_below is a histogram of the 2-pt statistics autocorrelation probabilities

![stats_hist_vox]({{page.pics[4]}})

_this image shows the discretized density in each voxel for every slice of the microstructure next to slices of the actual monomer locations_

![density_slices]({{page.pics[5]}})

_in this image a voxel was considered 'crystalline' if the density exceeded 0.853 g/cm^3_

![densityTHR_slices]({{page.pics[6]}})

_this image shows the Hermans Orientation measure in each voxel_

![hermans_orientation_slices]({{page.pics[7]}})

_in this image a voxel was considered 'crystalline' if the Herman's Orientation measure exceeded 0.6_

![hermans_orientationTHR_slices]({{page.pics[8]}})

_this image shows the crystalline probability measure in each voxel_

![crystalline_probability_slices]({{page.pics[9]}})

_in this image a voxel was considered 'crystalline' if the Hermans Orientation measure exceed a value of 0.4_

![crystalline_probabilityTHR_slices]({{page.pics[10]}})
