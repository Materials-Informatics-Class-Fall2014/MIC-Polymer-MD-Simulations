## Introduction

The crystallization behavior of polymers (PE) from the melt is affected by various processing conditions. Through the selection of processing paths and procedures, (e.g. blow molding) the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation in polymeric materials can be controlled. These changes in structure directly affect mechanical properties of interest, therefore it is advantageous to understand how processing leads to structure in this materials system.

We want to characterize the linkage between processing (including material starting condition and the evolution of temperature and the stress/strain state) and structure (including the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation) in semi-crystalline polyethylene.

## Current Research Questions

* How can we leverage the pair correlation of two chains to better understand the crystallinity in our data?

* How finely can we discretize our data without sacrificing accuracy in the determination of crystallinity?

vs.

* How finely must we discretize our data to achieve useful spatial statistics?
