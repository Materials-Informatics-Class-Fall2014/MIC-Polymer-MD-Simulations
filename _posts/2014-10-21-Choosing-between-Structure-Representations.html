## Introduction

The crystallization behavior of polymers (PE) from the melt is affected by various processing conditions. Through the selection of processing paths and procedures, (e.g. blow molding) the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation in polymeric materials can be controlled. These changes in structure directly affect mechanical properties of interest, therefore it is advantageous to understand how processing leads to structure in this materials system.

We want to characterize the linkage between processing (including material starting condition and the evolution of temperature and the stress/strain state) and structure (including the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation) in semi-crystalline polyethylene.

### VMD Visualization of Constant Volume Uniaxial Tension Experiment

As we are still uncertain of the extent of the usefulness of some of our simulation results, we decided to move ahead with the constant volume uniaxial tension simulation results. The following gallery (images generated by VMD) shows the effect of uniaxial tension with strains varying between 0.1 and 1.0.

### 2-point Statistics for Entire Simulation Volume

One option for structural characterization is to bin every monomer, irrespective of the chain it is associated with, into a spatial bin. Bins with a value of 1 contain a monomer, while bins with a value of 0 do not. Then an auto-correlation can be performed for all elements (spatial bins) with a value of 1.

_The entire simulation volume_

The non-periodic, three-dimensional 2-point statistics (using [SpatialStatisticsFFT]({{page.links[0]}})) were calculated for the entire simulation volume for the first timestep. These statistics show a pattern particular to the structure of crystalline Polyethylene. The below image is a two dimensional representation of these statistics from the z = 0 slice.

The following image is a representation of the three-dimensional 2-point statistics. Essentially, each point plotted is a location in the 2-point statistics with a probability greater than the specified threshold.

## Current Research Questions

* How can we leverage the pair correlation of two chains to better understand the crystallinity in our data?

* How finely can we discretize our data without sacrificing accuracy in the determination of crystallinity?

vs.

* How finely must we discretize our data to achieve useful spatial statistics?
