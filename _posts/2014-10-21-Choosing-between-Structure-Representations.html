## Introduction

The crystallization behavior of polymers (PE) from the melt is affected by various processing conditions. Through the selection of processing paths and procedures, (e.g. blow molding) the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation in polymeric materials can be controlled. These changes in structure directly affect mechanical properties of interest, therefore it is advantageous to understand how processing leads to structure in this materials system.

We want to characterize the linkage between processing (including material starting condition and the evolution of temperature and the stress/strain state) and structure (including the evolution of crystallinity and crystalline orientation) in semi-crystalline polyethylene.

### 2-point Statistics on Voxelized Simulation Volume

One option is to discretize the simulation volume into smaller spatial bins (voxels). Each of these bins can be further discretized into sub-voxels, so that the location of every monomer is represented by a 1, while all other locations are assigned zero. Then, an auto-correlation can be performed in each larger bin for the monomers. It is hoped that the 2-point statistics for crystalline regions will match the 2-point statistics of an idealized polyethylene crystal to some degree. Using this methodology it is hoped that the degree of crystallinity and orientation of sptatial regions can be characterized.

### 2-point Statistics for Entire Simulation Volume

Another option for structural characterization is to bin every monomer, irrespective of the chain it is associated with, into a spatial bin. Bins with a value of 1 contain a monomer, while bins with a value of 0 do not. Then an auto-correlation can be performed for all elements (spatial bins) with a value of 1.

_The entire simulation volume_

![simvol_tilt6]({{page.simvol[0]}})

The non-periodic, three-dimensional 2-point statistics (using [SpatialStatisticsFFT]({{page.links[0]}})) were calculated for the entire simulation volume for the first timestep. These statistics show a pattern particular to the structure of crystalline Polyethylene. The below image is a two dimensional representation of these statistics from the z = 0 slice.

The following image is a representation of the three-dimensional 2-point statistics. Essentially, each point plotted is a location in the 2-point statistics with a probability greater than the specified threshold.

### Herman's Orientation Calculation on Voxelized Simulation Volume

S = 3/2 < \cos^2\theta > -1/2

*[Herman's Orientation](http://www.plastics-elearning.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=116&Itemid=) describes the orientation of a polymer chain with respect to a reference axis. 
*As an update: we will likely abandon the idea of finding the best best line through each chain within a voxel. Instead we will find the vector for every other atom (avoid counting bond angle in directionality).
    * Those vectors will be averaged for an average direction (reference axis). The Herman's Orientation will be measured for each "every other atom" vector, then averaged.
* If chains are oriented (crystalline) Herman's will be close to 1. For completely amorphous we can expect something more around 0.5. 

*Herman's orientation is a way for us to get degree of crystallinity within a voxel.

*Other techniques will be applied to obtain crystal orientation.


* Below is unit cell for PE, orthorhombic. The perfect crystal image above is based on this.

## Current Research Questions

* How can we leverage the pair correlation of two chains to better understand the crystallinity in our data?

* How finely can we discretize our data without sacrificing accuracy in the determination of crystallinity?

vs.

* How finely must we discretize our data to achieve useful spatial statistics?
