title: Rundown of the Data in our Possession
---

* Data can be accessed at this [public dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ojehgtsbl58ijid/AAD_ah4p5cv7_fE0UhA03JF6a/Polymer-Data-GT-Jacobs?dl=0)
* My information is mainly coming from [this paper](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9281343&fileId=S1946427414005430)

### All Files

1. 20 united atom PE chains with ~400 repeating units
2. 1 ns constant stress simulation performed at 500 K and atmsohperic pressure
   *Generates well equilibrated melt
3. Cool to 425 K at 2 K/ns (still isotropic)

----
Below conditions not for constant stress?

* Biaxial strain applied - 2x in X and 3x in Y
* Quench melt to 375 K, hold for 20 ns

### pe400tilt6l : Constant Volume Files

1. constant strain rate of 10e7
2. Poisson ratio assumed 0.5
3. Crystallization time of 10ns - total strain of 1 in z dimension

### aniso : Constant Stress Files

1. Start from unoriented melt, 425 K for 2 ns (equilibration)
2. Quench melt to 375 K
3. Constant stress of 800 MPa in z-axis
4. timestep - 1 femtosecond
5. 20 ns total crystallization process
