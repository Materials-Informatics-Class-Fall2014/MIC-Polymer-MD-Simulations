In order to more realistically represent the structure of the polyethylene structure each monomer was assigned a radius of half the carbon-carbon bond distance. This also improves the usefulness of the autocorrelation of the monomers as it increases the monomer volume fraction in the microstructure function.

The following two images show the microstucture functions of both imperfect and perfect crystals. Each purple circle represents a voxel of the monomer phase. The yellow circles show the center of each monomer (before binning)

The next two images are autocorrelations for monomers in both imperfect and perfect crystals. Note that the orientation of each crystal is different so the same slice of the autocorrelation for each crystal shows a different pattern.

The following plots show the histograms of probabilities for the autocorrelation of monomers in both imperfect and perfect crystals. It is hoped that the levels of the histogram in certain bins (as compared to the histogram for a perfect crystal) will yield information about the degree of crystallinity in that bin.
