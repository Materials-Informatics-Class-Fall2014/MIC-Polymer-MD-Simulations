### Plots

The purpose of this post is to highlight a few plots that may be able to shed light on some of the phenomena seen in the aniso simulations. All plots are from the dump.deform375_10e7_5aniso_14 simulation file. A video showing the progress of this simulation can be viewed [here]().

Similar plots from the other 4 aniso simulations can be viewed in this [flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/126731708@N03/sets/72157647821108278/)

### Relevant Codes

The codes which produced these plots can be found at this [link](https://github.com/alohse/MIC-Polymer-MD-Simulations/tree/gh-pages/CODES)

**The relevant codes include:**

* read_conv_data_nhp_v2.m : This script reads the plaintext simulation files and produces a matlab file (total_info_xx.mat), containing arrays of the timesteps, number of monomers, bounds of the simulation volume and locations of all monomers and chains for the length of the simulation. _Note that the original aniso files have some corrupted data which must be removed for the script to function._

* plot_vol_displacement_timestep.m : This script generates three plots for each simulation dataset
