## Plotting Realizations of Spatiotemporal Data

Both (1.) time steps, (2.) processing conditions, and (4.) number of atoms are metadata on a spatial visualization.  In the case of (4.),
see in this post I have [embedded the number of atoms and chains as front-matter](https://github.com/alohse/MIC-Polymer-MD-Simulations/blob/bf3400f90f1a7e2611c6dd81f6a1849e726134c9/_posts/2014-09-10-Upload-Datasets.html). 
That is to say that information will be provided as context to the visualization in the form of 
a title, comment, or other annotation.  A typical spatiotemporal visualization will plot the field values
or local states at the spatial positions they are sampled at.

> The above visualization illustrates the evolution of surface curvature (illustrated by the colormap) sampled at 
non-uniform positions in space.  Each subplot is illustrating the spatial variation of a local state at a place in time under a
set of experiment conditions (ie. control parameters, boundary conditions).

## Plotting Spatial Datasets

When plotting 3-D datasets, usually the colors annotate local state or field variables and the position of points or voxels define the
spatial domain.

### Plotting Voxel Data

Voxel data has a uniformly-gridded spatial data and each value in a voxel is a *numerical* or *categorical* local state or
response variable.  

#### 3-D Contour Plots in Matlab

* [**Vol3d**](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22940-vol3d-v2) is a great visualization tool on [MathLab Central](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/).
* [**SliceoMatic**] serves up interactive visualizations with controls on the slices plotted, isosurfaces, and transparencies.

## Plotting Temporal Derivatives of SpatioTemporal Data

Plotting voxel data and non-uniformally sampled data require two different procedures.

### Voxel Data Use Case

Assume $A1$ and $A2$ are ``3-D`` arrays sampled at times $t1$ and $t2$, respectively.  A simple element-wise [numerical derivative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation)
can be computed producing $dA$:

$$dA_i = \frac{A2_i-A1_i}{t2-t1}\forall{i}$$

$i$ indicates pixel values.  $dA$ is a new 3-D array that can be visualized using a 3-D contour plot (*see above*).

> The spatial domain is defined by the [index notation](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_notation) in your voxel array.  The values 
in each voxel are ``numerical`` or ``categorical`` local state or response values.

### Non-uniformly Gridded Data Use Case

> This is the case for the polymer datasets.  There may be a scenario were you grid the voxel data and the Voxel case will apply.

Assume $B1$ and $B2$ are ``Nx4`` arrays sampled at times $t1$ and $t2$, respectively. ``N`` is the number spatial positions
sampled with the first **3** columns are ``x``,``y``, and ``z`` positions, respectively, with the **last** column
providing ``numerical`` or ``categorical`` local state or response values.

**Requiring** each row in $B1$ and $B2$ correspond to the same tracking point.  *Someone help me say this better please.*

$$dB_i = \frac{B2_i-B1_i}{t2-t1}\forall{i}$$

$i$ indicates each array index.  $dB$ is a new ``Nx4`` where the first **3** columns are changes ``x``,``y``, and ``z`` positions, respectively, with the **last** column
providing change in a ``numerical`` local state or response values.

A [quiver plot](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/quiver.html) is useful to visualize this type of data.  One could 
discretize the local state space and plot different colored quivers corresponding to the magnitude in the change of the 
local state and the length of the quivers illustrate the change in position.  *Categorical fields are likely independent of time.*
