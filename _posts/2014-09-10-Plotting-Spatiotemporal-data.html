## Plotting Realizations of Spatiotemporal Data

Both (1.) time steps and (2.) processing conditions are metadata on a spatial visualization.  
That is to say that information will be provided as context to the visualization in the form of 
a title, comment, or other annotation.  A typical spatiotemporal visualization will plot the field values
or local states at the spatial positions they are sampled at.

> The above visualization illustrates the evolution of surface curvature ( illustrated by the colormap ) sampled at 
non-uniform positions in space.  Each subplot is illustrating the spatial variation of a local state at a place in time under a
set of experiment conditions (ie. control parameters, boundary conditions).
